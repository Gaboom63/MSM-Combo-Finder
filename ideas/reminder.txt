How did I fix the images not correctly moving? 

I switched back over to using ixels instead of percents, and vh / vw. Maybe not the most 
practical soulution, but the fix needed for now :)

generateCostumes.js is finished, you use it by runing node generateCostumes.js and it will give you everything! (I moved it into this folder due to wanting to maintane a clean file structure)
